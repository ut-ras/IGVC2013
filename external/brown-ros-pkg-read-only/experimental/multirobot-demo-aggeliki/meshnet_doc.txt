Assume Ubuntu installation (Our installation: Ubuntu Remix 9.10 karmic).

Procedure:
[1] Create Mobile Ad-Hoc Network among the robots

(a) Configure wireless interface of each robot (modify /etc/network/interfaces file):
Example /etc/network/interfaces file (assuming name of wireless interface is wlan0):

auto lo 
iface lo inet loopback

auto wlan0                           #configure wireless interface
iface wlan0 inet static              #static IP
wireless-mode ad-hoc                 #ad-hoc network
wireless-ap 00:60:1D:01:23:45        #all robots in the network should have the same access point address (no real meaning for access point in an ad-hoc network though)
wireless-essid rlab_mesh_test        #name of the network
address 192.168.0.2                  #IP address of node
netmask 255.255.255.0                #subnet mask


(b) Activate wireless interface by typing:
- sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager stop      #stop the network manager utility (preparation for customized configuration of the wlan0)
- sudo ifdown wlan0                          #bring the wlan0 interface down (cancel out any existing configurations for wlan0)
- sudo ifup wlan0                            #bring wlan0 up again (the configuration options from /etc/network/interfaces will be applied)

** At this point you should be able to use the ping command from one robot to the other

[2] Run OLSR (www.olsr.org) mesh networking protocol for transparency in robot communication (automatic identification of nodes entering/leaving the network, communication among nodes just using TCP)
- sudo olsrd -w wlan0 -d 1

** Currently we use olsrd-0.6.0. Install OLSR based on the olsr.org instructions. You will also need to make the olsrd-txtinfo.so.0.1 plugin that is inside "OLSRD_DIR"/lib/txtinfo before running olsrd:
- sudo make
- sudo make install

** Steps [1](b) and [2] are included in the wifi_net_setup file.

[3] Install the boxturtle version of ROS (http://www.ros.org/wiki/boxturtle/Installation/Ubuntu/Deb). Additional nodes from brown-ros-pkg (http://code.google.com/p/brown-ros-pkg/) and isr-ros-pkg may be needed. Then, run the ROS nodes you need.

** Look at the directory with the extra ROS code. The ./aggeliki/multirobot_coordination/coverage_controller_nomap and ./aggeliki/multirobot_coordination/coverage_potentfield_nomap packages are the main ones and in the .launch files inside them you will see all the other nodes the coverage controller depends on (+ foreign_relay).

ROS nodes that may be necessary: 
- irobot_create_2_1: ROS driver for an iCreate
- position_tracker: tracks the current position of the robot
- gscam: Gstreamer-based webcam driver for ROS
- ar_recog: recognition of ARTags and calculation of their location/transformation in image spcae
- ar_localizer: updates the position reported from position_tracker based on localization information coming from ARTags
* Both for position_tracker and ar_localizer I'm using intermediate versions of the code (not the latest ones) that are compatible with boxturtle and the netbook camera.

- foreign_relay: sends (relays) a topic from one master to another one
- wifi_comm (highly based on the code from isr-ros-package, but modified it for our case): contains nodes for discovering robots being added/removed from the network and transfers topics to different robots (using foreign_relay)

multirobot_coordination folder:
- step_navigator_nomap: direct navigation to a goal position
- bumper_localizer_nomap: recover from bumping to obstacles or other robots
- coverage_controller_nomap: multi robot coordination controller (for position based coverage - see AAMAS'11 paper)
- coverage_potentfield_nomap: multi robot coordination controller (for wifi and position based coverage - see AAMAS'11 paper) -- comment out line 61 of coverage_potentfield_nomap.cpp for the static robot

multirobot_coordination_map folder:
- map_loader: loads a line-based and graph-based map of the environment from the predefined input files
- path_generator: generates a path from a starting position to a goal position
- path_navigator: navigates through a path from start to end
- step_navigator: direct navigation to a goal position
- bumper_localizer: recover from bumping to obstacles or other robots
- coverage_controller: multi robot coordination controller (for position based coverage - see AAMAS'11 paper)
- coverage_potentfield: multi robot coordination controller 
- rest of code: mainly intermediate code that was used for debugging or is now included in the abovementioned ROS nodes

* In order for foreign_relay to work properly, the receiver node should be included in the /etc/hosts file of the sender node.

** (Optional) In my .bashrc file I also added the following lines (see ROS.org and brown-ros-pkg/gscam documentation):
source /opt/ros/boxturtle/setup.sh
export GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! videoscale ! video/x-raw-rgb,width=160,height=120 ! ffmpegcolorspace ! identity name=ros ! fakesink"
